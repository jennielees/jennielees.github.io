Coming soon.

No, really. I love the future. I love the ways our industry -- excuse me, _industries_ -- change from moment to moment. How big sweeps come out of nowhere when really they were there all along.

But one thing I've never claimed to be is omniscient. I enjoy living in darkness. Making each day one more step through a fog of war. Charting my own map.

Life is agile, see.

So instead of predicting the future, I'll share the principles I hope will guide the next few years of my life and career.

## Principles

* Level up those around me
* Give kindness
* Tackle the hard stuff
* Say yes more

What're yours?
