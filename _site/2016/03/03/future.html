<p>Coming soon.</p>

<p>No, really. I love the future. I love the ways our industry – excuse me, <em>industries</em> – change from moment to moment. How big sweeps come out of nowhere when really they were there all along.</p>

<p>But one thing I’ve never claimed to be is omniscient. I enjoy living in darkness. Making each day one more step through a fog of war. Charting my own map.</p>

<p>Life is agile, see.</p>

<p>So instead of predicting the future, I’ll share the principles I hope will guide the next few years of my life and career.</p>

<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Level up those around me</li>
  <li>Give kindness</li>
  <li>Tackle the hard stuff</li>
  <li>Say yes more</li>
</ul>

<p>What’re yours?</p>
