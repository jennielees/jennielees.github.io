<p>It’s 1992.</p>

<p>I’m a fanatical subscriber to <em>Your Sinclair</em> magazine.</p>

<p>Every month, I spend my hard-earned pocket money at the corner shop, pop the demo tape into my ZX Spectrum and type in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">PEEK</code>s and <code class="highlighter-rouge">POKE</code>s. I transcribe printed lines of BASIC and get tripped up by typos.</p>

<p>Someone writes in. They’re stuck in a game I’ve recently finished, <em>Slightly Magic</em> – in fact, stuck at a part that stumped me for the longest time. I submit a tip to the magazine and mostly forget about it.</p>

<p>And there it is. In the <a href="https://archive.org/stream/your-sinclair-76/YourSinclair_76_Apr_1992#page/n37/mode/2up">April issue</a>. Right after my tenth birthday, my name in glorious print:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="slightly-magic">SLIGHTLY MAGIC</h4>
  <p>Andrew Malcolm, Alex Schmitz, Ian Hewett and Jennie Lees are literally four of the people who dashed off an answer to Alex Marsh’s plea, “How do you get into the yellow grass?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder what Andrew, Alex and Ian are up to now.</p>
